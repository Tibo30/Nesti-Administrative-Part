The aim of the project is to create, for a fictional company named Nesti, a Connection form for a Java application.
  
They are four main parts for this app :  
* Registration,  
* Connection,  
* Display of the user's information,  
* Modification of the user's information,  
  
Several requirements had to be respected:  
* The user can use either his email or his nickname to connect,  
* Firstname, Lastname and city can be registered but are not mandatory,
* The password must be strong enough (medium or strong),
* After being connected, a new windows open and the user sees his information that he can modify, 
* The user can't modify his email adress.

To use this connection form, you have to copy all the files :
* 22 java files,
* 4 pictures (not the LogInPage picture).
